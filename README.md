# s²LFM-Net
High-speed multi-channel volumetric microscopy via spatial-spectral encoding(under review)
# Overview
Here, we proposed a deep-learning decoder, **s²LFM-Net**, to accurately reconstruct the 3D multi-spectral fluorescent distributions from ill-posed, RGB-encoded, light-field measurements. By jointly leveraging spatial, angular, and spectral cues, our decoder **s²LFM-Net** surpasses SOTA unmixing techniques for such ill-posed tasks in fidelity and inference speed across diverse imaging scenarios. With the help of **s²LFM-Net**, we can now reconstruct up to 8 channels information with high spectral fidelity and inference speed from light field RGB measurements. Next, we will show you the intruction of **s²LFM-Net** step by step.
